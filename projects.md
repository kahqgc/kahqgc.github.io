**Description:**  
A mobile-first, game-show-style web app that helps users decide where to eat in St. Louis by filtering cuisine and budget or generating a completely random restaurant for a fun, low-pressure decision-making experience.

**Tech Stack:**  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Filtering Logic:** Filters restaurants by cuisine and price using JavaScript array methods like `.filter()` and `.map()` on a structured data set.
- **Randomized Selection Mode:** Generates a surprise restaurant pick that ignores filters, turning the app into a playful “decision game.”
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Designed primarily for phone use, with CSS media queries that transform the layout into a full-screen app experience on small devices.
- **Lightweight Architecture:** Frontend-only implementation with clean data modeling, making it easy to extend later with APIs or additional filters.
